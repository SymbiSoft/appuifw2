========

Appuifw2 is an external Python module for PyS60 (a port of Python for 
Nokia S60 platform). It is based on the built-in appuifw module providing 
access to the S60 application UI framework and extends it with additional 
and improved features.

Testing new Text control in Python Shell
========================================

Open the Python Shell and select Interactive Console from Options menu.
Execute the following commands:

>>> import appuifw, appuifw2, __main__, series60_console
>>> appuifw.Text = lambda t=u'': appuifw2.Text(t, skinned=True)
>>> __main__.my_console = series60_console.Console()
>>>

Now close the interactive console using the Exit key. The screen will
switch to a fully skinned Text console. You can reopen the console or
start some scripts to test it.

The background will remain skinned until you close the Python Shell.
