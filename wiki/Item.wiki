#summary Item object, represents a Listbox2 item and a Menu item

Item objects are used by the [Listbox2] and [Menu] classes to represent listbox items and menu items, respectively.

=== Usage ===

{{{
item = Item(title, ...)
}}}

Creates a new Item instance.

  * *title* is the item title (unicode) and is mandatory; it can be read or changed after instantiation using the `title` object attribute,
  * If specified, additional keyword arguments are converted into object attributes.

=== Example ===

{{{
menu = Menu()
menu.append(Item(u'Test1.txt', myfile=open('c:\\test1.txt')))
menu.append(Item(u'Test2.txt', myfile=open('c:\\test2.txt')))
item = menu.popup()
if item is not None:
    print item.myfile.read()
}}}
See the [Menu] class for explanation of its methods.

=== Notes ===

The ability to set any object attributes let you easily store your private data in the items. This is shown in the example above.

If used as a [Listbox2] item, the `title` as well as the listbox specific attributes like `subtitle` or `marked` can be set to change the listbox appearance.
