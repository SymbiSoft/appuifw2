#summary Native S60 text viewer

Text_display represents a native S60 text viewer control. Text_display objects can be used with either appuifw.app.body or appuifw2.app.body properties.

Text_display is based on [Text] class. As such it provides all its methods and properties but limits the user input capabilities. The cursor is not visible and the user cannot change the text. Additionally the up/down arrow keys used to scroll the text.

=== Usage ===

{{{
text = Text_display(text=u'', skinned=False, scrollbar=False, scroll_by_line=False)
}}}

Creates a new Text_display instance.

  * *text* is the text to view,
  * *skinned* if `True`, enables a skinned background, this also changes the text color from dark green to a skin dependent color best suited for the skin in use,
  * *scrollbar* if `True`, enables a vertical scrollbar (see the [Text] class remarks),
  * *scroll_by_line* if `True`, the up/down arrow keys scroll the text by line instead of page.

=== Remarks ===

If you need special formatting, don't use the `text` argument but add the text after creation of the control using the methods and properties provided by the [Text] class. Remember to set the cursor position to 0 before displaying the control on the screen.
